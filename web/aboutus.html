<p>Flexible Event Management:
At Outsourced Events, it�s our job to turn your ideas into a reality. Central to this is our flexible and responsive event management service. 
We can provide this as a complete end-to-end service or as individual discrete elements that can work alongside your own internal
event planning and marketing resources. However you want to work, we are agile enough to fit to your needs. 
No two events are quite the same which is why we take the time to understand exactly what it is you want to achieve, 
before putting together a comprehensive event management plan. Depending on your requirements,
this could cover everything from creative concept development through to logistics, finance planning,
event marketing and post-event follow up. We will then assign you a dedicated client manager who will be your key contact from the 
beginning of the project through to its end. We work on either a project by project basis, or on a retainer.</p>

<p>Events that Stick in the Mind:
A successful corporate event should stick in the mind, not fade into mundanity. 
We know the importance of creating a lasting impression for your attendees and vendors alike,
 but we�re also committed to making sure your event achieves everything you�ve set out to do. 
This is why we�ll never let artistic vision override established business goals and logistical realities. 
We know what works and we know what doesn�t. We have the ability to adapt to your working practices and processes but we also 
believe that the way to build inspirational events from the ground up is to become an integral part of your team. 
Our passion for event planning is matched only by our experience, professionalism and friendliness. 
We love working with our clients and as a result they love working with us.</p>

<p>Experts in Technology Event Management:
We have been working with major blue-chip technology firms since 2001 and are one of the leading UK events management and 
marketing service providers to the industry. We have worked with some of our clients for over a decade and over the years have come to 
view many of them as colleagues and friends, as much as clients. Our focus and experience working in the technology sector has given us 
a deep insight into how this industry works and to appreciate the speed at which new technological developments can resonate across the
 wider market. As well as technology event management, we are also fully committed to adopting new technologies as an agency. 
Our print on demand badging and registration service is a prime example of this, using proprietary software to allow instant badge printing 
on site and present a slick, professional first contact for delegates.</p>
